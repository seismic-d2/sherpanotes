### 1. Kalli, the Corrupted

Summary: "We need to cleanse 6 plates and kill their respective knights, after that we will damage the boss in 3 chunks, hiding behind blast doors between those 3 chunks of DPS."

1. **Objective:** Defeat Kalli, the Corrupted.

2. **Sightseeing:** Show all 9 plates in the 3 thirds of the room, the symbols floating in the middle, how those correspond to the plates. It is also possible to show the doors by carefully dropping down while the others stand across on the other side.

3. **Quick Rundown:** Each player finds a plate corresponding to the symbols in the middle, stands on it, making sure to stand in the clear part that isn't consumed by taken goo. This clear part switches 3-4 times, after that the plate is cleansed, orangebar knight spawns, and when killed the player can go to the middle and wait. DPS begins when Kalli appears, and about 20s later the doors will open and players will have to hide inside. When the doors open, they head outside again, continue damaging for another 20s. repeat for the last third, and then the encounter begins afresh.

4. **In Detail:** On each plate, the taken goo swaps around 3 times. After it changes 3 times, the orangebar knight spawns. Killing this knight is necessary since otherwise there will not be enough doors to survive the mid-DPS wipe animation. While cleansing, Kalli may occasionally appear near a player's plate, simply shooting her will cause her to leave the player alone and go elsewhere. Cleansing the wrong plate spawns an Ogre in middle. DPS start is signaled by "Kalli conceives an ontological weapon", and from there about 15s pass until "Kalli prepares to wield her weapon" appears, at which point players should pay attention since the doors will open roughly 5s later. Only 1 player fits behind each door. Once the doors reopen, a few psions will spawn in middle, and players will again have roughly 20s total to damage Kalli, with the "prepare her weapon" message again appearing about 5s before doors open. Kalli is in a different third of the middle arena for each DPS chunk. These steps are simply repeated until DPS concludes. If Kalli is not dead yet, 3 pairs of new symbols will spawn in the middle, and the entire plate cleansing mechanic begins again.

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** Not killing enough knights, meaning there will be a lack of doors for the wipe animation. Having players get in the doors too late. 

6. **Combat:** mainly taken thrall and taken psions, with the orangebar knights being mechanically relevant. (The ogres that spawn in middle if the incorrect plate is cleansed are yellowbars.)

### 2. Shuro Chi, the Corrupted:

Summary: "We need to clear adds, drop the boss' shield and do 6 chunks of damage. We need to do this on 3 separate floors, with a puzzle between each floor that we need to solve before our timer runs out."

1. **Objective:** defeat Shuro Chi, the Corrupted

2. **Sightseeing:** It is very helpful to trespass into the encounter early to show players the puzzle/elevator room and integrate that into the explanation. It is also possible to show players all 6 damage "gazebos" and both puzzle rooms, essentially simulating a full run-through of the encounter. 

3. **Quick Rundown:** Players will spread into the room, clearing all the adds as quickly as possible. The "Eye of Riven" taken captain drops an item, simply ignore it (explanation in pt. 4). As soon as "Shuro's tempo quickens" appears, 3 nuts will spawn, one on each plate, which players will have to pick up and form a triangle around the boss with by shooting at each other while standing on the plates. These plates damage the players over time. This drops her shields, "Shuro's tempo resumes", and players will be able to damage her for max. 1/6th of her health. This same process is repeated for every gazebo. In the puzzle rooms, players must fill out the missing pieces of the puzzle by using the corresponding plates on the floor, these are always oriented for the active puzzle. A player can only step on each plate once, after that it will not activate. Once all 3 puzzles are completed, the encounter timer resets and a set of platforms lower, allowing players to ascend to the next level.

4. **In Detail:** The Eye of Riven drops a taken essence, which can be used to stun Shuro Chi mid-DPS phase to prevent her from wiping. While the DPS phase is active, Shuro sings a different song, and when this song ends, the team is wiped, unless they reach the damage gate of 1/6th. This taken essence builds stacks up to x10, at which point the player dies. The stun is executed using the super ability. Since the damage checks are trivial with modern DPS setups, this entire stunning mechanic is superfluous and it's better to leave the buff on the ground. The plates damage players over time, however this damage can be reduced by blocking with a sword, and can be cancelled out by healing sources. For each gazebo it is essential that the process of grabbing the nuts, getting on the plates, forming the triangle and dropping her shield is done as fast as possible, since the encounter timer runs down quicker during this time (*cody's notes*: No need to focus on enemy types or timer acceleration during damage phases. Just skip it..). For the puzzle room, players cannot stand on the same physical plate twice, but they can stand in the same position twice relative to the puzzle being solved (excluding middle), since f.ex "top right" is a different physical plate for each 3 puzzles. With each puzzle completed, "Command accepted" will appear in the chat, and with all 3 completed, the platforms will lower. These will rotate after a few seconds, and this interaction is client-sided. The only difference at the final damage gazebo is that adds will spawn during the DPS phase itself, otherwise it remains the same.

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** Dying to the encounter timer running out, which can happen for a multitude of reasons. Having players standing on plates too long, both during pre-DPS and during the puzzles will kill them, draining res tokens. Being stomped or booped off the map. Getting physics-ed will swording Shuro Chi.

6. **Combat:** mainly redbars, although these increase in tiers from only thrall on the first floor, to psions on the second floor, and acolytes on the third floor. redbar knights, orangebar captains (1 per gazebo) and yellowbar ogres (1 per floor) are present throughout. redbar phalanxes also appear in and after the elevator rooms.

### 3. Morgeth, the Spirekeeper

Summary: "We need to collect a total of 10 taken strengths while having to cleanse 2 players to prevent them from dying, all of which unlocks the damage phase on the boss.

1. **Objective:** defeat Morgeth, the Spirekeeper

2. **Sightseeing:** It is possible and helpful to tour the encounter, showing where the taken strengths can spawn, along with where to stand for cleansing and where to stand for DPS.

3. **Quick Rundown:** Collecting the strengths is split into 2 waves of 5, the first wave starts with picking up the first buff in the middle (first-last player), then after some add-clear, 2 strengths will spawn on either side, these need to be picked up by their respective player (first left and first right). Shortly thereafter, one of them will randomly become "tornadoed" (Umbral Enervation, 20s). A player (first cleanse) will have to kill an Eye of Riven, pick up the taken essence, and cleanse the tornadoed player, transferring the 2x stacks of taken strength to themselves. The second wave will again have 2 strengths per side that need to be picked up (second left and second right), with the cleansed player now having the responsibility to cleanse whichever player gets tornadoed in the second wave. Shortly thereafter, the 10th and final strength will spawn in the middle (first-last), and picking it up unlocks the DPS phase.

4. **In Detail:** Part 3 already fully describes the rotations of who does what. This setup leaves one player without any interaction with the mechanics, acting as a backup of sorts (*cody's notes:* Don't put sherpees on first-last job, it does not engage with mechanics at all). For the strength collectors, it is important that they jump through the taken strength orbs, simply walking underneath them will usually not work. After picking up, it is very useful if all players with x2 strength gather in a pre-determined place, since this makes the cleanser's job easier. Players can only pick up x2 strength at most (putting aside the various cheeses that bypass this limit), and only players with x2 strength can be tornadoed, so players with x1 or none are safe. For the cleanser, it is generally good to be around the middle, to shorten paths to potential Eye of Riven spawns. Cleansing a player is done by standing right up against them and using the grenade ability of the taken essence. Morgeth will gradually gain strength during the encounter, reaching 10% after about 60s, with him beginning to shoot a lot of axion darts at 60% and wiping the team if he reaches 100% strength. For the first-last player, their final strength will not spawn unless all orangebars, so all Eyes of Riven and all taken vandals, have been killed. The first set of strengths spawn about 40s after starting. While most runs will see teams one-phasing this boss, he can be stunned to prevent a wipe. Any player will simply have to pick up a taken essence left behind by an Eye of Riven, and use its super attack (same as for stunning Shuro Chi!) on Morgeth before he hits 100% strength. This will cause "Morgeth's focus is broken and his strength is lost!" to appear, which immediately removes all stacks of taken strength from all players, his own strength to go back down to 0% and the encounter to start afresh. 

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** Picking up a third taken strength kills a player and causes all picked up strengths to return to the field. Any player with strength dying causes their strengths to return to the field, which can significantly mess up any rotations. Letting the Umbral Enervation timer expire, i.e. failing to cleanse in time has the same effect. Allowing Morgeth to reach 100% strength will wipe the team.

6. **Combat:** mainly redbar psions, a few redbar ogres, the mechanically relevant Eyes of Riven, and orangebar taken vandals. Morgeth, being a taken ogre, is able to push players back with his beam, just like his cousin Vorgeth in the Shattered Throne.

### 4. The Vault:

Summary: "We have 3 rounds: in each round we need to first do some reading to find out which plate needs which sort of cleanse, then each room will have their dedicated player pick up a buff and cleanse a specific plate, until all 3 are cleansed. Then we start from the top again, and repeat these mechanics twice more."

1. **Objective:** Unlock the Vault to proceed further.

2. **Sightseeing:** It is helpful to show the 3 rooms, along with how they are connected via tunnels. The encounter is fully accessible and explorable.

3. **Quick Rundown:** 3 players will get on the plates, with one player calling out their middle symbol that is shown on the little display in front of them. One of the other players will answer whether they have it on their left or right side on their display, and will then call out their own middle symbol. This will go in a circle until we've figured out all 3 plates and whether they had the symbol on their left or right. Plates that had it on the left will need a penumbral essence, plates that had it on the right need an antumbral essence. Throughout the entire encounter, players will have to clear adds, particularly yellowbar knights "Might of Riven" which will try to stab the plates. 2 of the rooms will close, with the one remaining open being the one where the eye of riven spawns. A player will need to kill it and pick up the essence, calling out which one they have, with the other players calling out which room has opened. The player with the essence will use the tunnels to exit via the called-out room, and will then cleanse on a plate corresponding to their type of essence. This process is repeated with the other 2 rooms to cleanse the other 2 plates. After that, the next round begins from the top again. 

4. **In Detail:** Part 3 covers the general rotation for the most part. Cleansing is done with the grenade ability. It is important to note that outside of the reading phase, only 1 of the 3 rooms will be open to the middle at once. This means that players will have to use the tunnels to go to middle or between rooms. Adds are generally unaffected by this, especially the Mights of Rivens who can just run straight through. As such, setting up 3 dedicated add-clearers who stay in the rooms, with the 3 reader runners staying in middle (unless their room is open) is generally the safest bet. For reading, it isn't absolutely necessary to read all 3 plates, since knowing 2 of the plates is enough, since the 3rd one will be whatever is left. A plate will NEVER have the middle symbol from another player twice. There will also NEVER be 3 of one buff type, it is ALWAYS 2 of and 1 of the other. Knowing that, players will be able to catch any potential reading mistakes. Theoretically speaking, the reading can be trimmed down so far that players only call out their middle symbol, since this will cause them to respond to each other in the correct sequence anyway. Players can then make a mental note of their plate type, and call it out, with only the odd one out needing to be noted down. 

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** There is an encounter timer which will wipe the team if it expires. If a Might of Riven manages to slam any plate and stab its sword into it, it will also wipe the team. Incorrect reads or incorrect cleanses will both cause the player to die when they try to cleanse, which creates a time crunch. 

6. **Combat:** mainly redbars, psions, acolytes, goblins, phalanxes, thrall. the mechanically relevant orangebar eye of riven returns, and the might of riven is a yellowbar taken knight.

### 5. Riven of a Thousand Voices

Summary: "We are doing the cheese, so we simply need to drop down, and out-DPS the mechanics. If we pick the wrong room, we will do the actual cheese, which is joining allies, which lets us go to the other room. There will be 2 final stands and a platforming section as well."

1. **Objective:** defeat Riven of a Thousand Voices

2. **Sightseeing:** Not much to show, other than where players will spawn after joining allies, and where they will have to go. The "stages" in this top room can be used to demonstrate roughly where to stand to damage Riven.

3. **Quick Rundown:** All 6 players get on the plates and drop down in the direction of the rally flag to the room with the crystal in front of it, head inside, and look towards the stage. If a shadow can be seen hushing across it, Riven is in that room and players can clear adds and wait for her to appear. If not, players will head out of the room and do the "Joining Allies" cheese to return to the top room. From there, they'll head right towards the tree and continue dropping down until they reach the room where Riven will be. Once Riven has crawled out on to the stage, players will be able to damage either her claw or her mouth, depending on the DPS meta at the time. The amount of time for DPS is quite short at around 15s. Once her damage gate is reached, players will be teleported to a taken realm where they must platform upwards and jump through a taken strength to return to the normal realm in the top room. Once there, players will once again damage the last bit of Riven's health. She will then have a death animation, after which players will have to jump down her throat and kill her heart to finish the encounter.

4. **In Detail:** Doing the cheese, there really isn't much to elaborate on here. There is a separate guide describing how to do the encounter legitimately. In theory, it makes no difference whether everyone goes to the crystal room or the other one, since Riven will appear in either of them anyway, and it's up to pure chance initially. Also sending all 6 players to damage Riven in 1 room straight away is not _technically_ a cheese, since doing DPS to Riven is part of the actual mechanics anyway. Using the Joining Allies glitch is a cheese however. In the taken platforming section, only 1 player needs to make it to the end and jump through the strength orb.

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** Failing the DPS check.

6. **Combats:** almost exclusively redbar psions, hobgoblins, phalanxes, and the mechanically relevant orangebar eye of riven who will not be expanded on in the scope of this guide.

### 6. Queenswalk

Summary: "We are essentially performing a relay race, wherein one player is always carrying the heart, and some other players are refreshing the timer for the carrier, while the team as a whole moves forwards to the goal where they will dunk the heart.

1. **Objective:** bring Riven's heart to the Techeuns.

2. **Sightseeing:** basically nothing to show or see.

3. **Quick Rundown:** Players will be "Fate's Chosen" at random, only they can pick up and carry the heart, and while doing so they can't use any weapons or abilities, but are able to double jump. They will also create a circular aura around them which removes stacks of "Creeping Darkness" from all players inside it, since those stacks otherwise build up. Fate's Chosen has a timer, which when it expires will cause the aura to collapse and the player carrying it and anyone in close proximity to the the player to be teleported. The heart will be on the ground and another player will be able to pick it up, and the teleported player will be in a different realm where they can pick up taken strengths (max 2) to refresh the Fate's Chosen timer. This requires communication and timing, and this process continues till players reach the end, where the carrier will dunk the orb.

4. **In Detail:** Part 3 covers pretty much most of it, but it cannot be stressed enough that this encounter practically hinges on 2 things: players stepping back when the Fate's Chosen timer expires, and timer refreshes. Having people accidentally teleported is the main reason this encounter fails, with the second reason being teleported players not paying attention and not picking up the taken strength. Players are technically teleported inside Riven's heart, and inside there it is only the last strength picked up that causes the refresh. The amount of strengths available corresponds to how many carriers have held the heart. As such, the first player can't have their timer refreshed. The timer can only be refreshed once for each carrier. For the later carriers, players should pick up all but one strength as soon as these spawn, and pick up the final one once the carrier's timer gets low. The finish has an interact prompt, simply walking up to it won't finish the encounter. It is also generally recommended to let the timer expire before the final drop, since the heart falls faster than the players. It is also helpful to assign the original Fate's Chosen player as the one to pick up the final strength to refresh the timer. This isn't mechanically necessary, it simply helps make things less chaotic. For the vault room, the end is the stairs room, but only rocks or trees will be open. Whichever one is open, the players will either turn only left or only right until they reach the stairs room.
(*cody's notes:* Don't explain the entire route, it will not help them, guide them along the way. You can explain how to deal with the vault room in advance, though.)

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** Not reaching the end, having all players teleported will wipe the team. Having players accidentally teleported or missing the timer refresh complicates things but isn't necessarily a wipe. Dying to creeping darkness.

6. **Combat:** Mainly redbar phalanxes, acolytes, thrall, with a few yellowbar and orangebar enemies here and there.

### Bonus Content:

**First Bonus chest:** located after clearing Kalli. On the 2nd pillar of the bridge, drop down on the right side to a ledge in the rock foundations. The chest will be there, and a portal will open teleporting players back up.

**Second Bonus chest:** located after clearing Shuro Chi. After dropping down the tower, climbing the tree and reaching the new loadzone, instead of following the path towards the Morgeth, head further left and platform up the side, where the chest will be up on a ledge by a tree.

**Bonus Goodies:**
- There is an OOB right at the beginning of the raid, right in the doorway.
- The wishwall.
- There is a corrupted egg located in the Kalli encounter, in a cave in the ceiling roughly between the 2nd and 3rd plates of the front third.
- There is a wish plate and some cats located in a cave just before Shuro Chi.
- There is a corrupted egg located in the Morgeth encounter, high up on the right side cliffside.
- There is a corrupted egg located after the Morgeth encounter, down in a crevice on the left side before entering the Awoken watchtower.
- There is also another chest located in the same area, but on the right side up on a small rocky formation. This chest can only be unlocked with a "Glittering Key" and will reward the legendary ship "Ermine TAC-717" required for the collections seal.
- There is a corrupted egg located in the vault encounter, on top of the gazebo at stairs. There is a hole in the ceiling outlined with crystals, the egg is at the end of it.
- There is another wish plate on top of the gazebo where Riven's heart is dunked at the end of Queenswalk.
