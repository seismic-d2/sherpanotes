- bonus chest at the end

### 1. Crypt Security:

_Summary: "We need to find 2 glowing datapads on each side, shoot them, then destroy the 6 fuses in the correct order to progress further."_

1. **Objective:** Find 2 glowing datapads on each side, shoot them, then destroy the 6 fuses in the correct order to progress further.

2. **Sightseeing:** light/dark side, 3 fuses on each side, 1 terminal per zone, datapads (1-5) from both scanner and operator POV, how to orient yourself as either scanner or operator (stairs), show mini-fuses downstairs.

3. **Quick Rundown:** Scanner begins on dark side and finds 2 datapads, passes to light side, they also find 2, the operator shoots those 4 downstairs, DPS begins and augments are swapped around, scanner calls out the glowing mini-fuse and upstairs players do DPS.

4. **In Detail:** Scanner Augment spawns on a Vandal on dark side. Once both dark side datapads are called out, operator goes downstairs and scanner is passed via terminal to light side. Dark side calls out their 2 glowing pads, operator shoots all the called out datapads. "Security shielding lowers, revealing a weakness.." + audio cue = time to send operator augment up, and scanner augment down (backup operator). Downstairs, now the scanner, calls out which mini-fuses are glowing, and upstairs players damage the respective ones. If no 1-phase, downstairs puts scanner in terminal, scanning begins again. Backup operator lets downstairs player out and does the same job.

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** Servitors "A Sentinel is blocking the augmentation terminals.." block augment transfer. Staying downstairs too long. Shooting the wrong datapad. Shooting the wrong fuses.

6. **Combat:** Pretty average add-density, mainly Dregs, Shanks, Wretches, Marauders downstairs. Overload champs once per side per phase. Yellow-bar Captains and Servitors.

### 2. Clarity Control/Atraks-1, Fallen Exo:

_Summary:_ "We need to clear all the adds, then we need to identify and damage the correct copy of the boss 4 times in a row, alternating between upstairs and downstairs, and pick up and dispose of the debuff dropped by each copy."

1. **Objective:** Defeat Atraks-1, Fallen Exo.

2. **Sightseeing:** Overview of the 3 areas downstairs, each with a terminal, show where to wait for the augment, from where to scan downstairs, then show the elevators. start the encounter and take all sherpees upstairs to show the areas, the 4 terminals, the airlocks, and where to stand for scanning.

3. **Quick Rundown:** Split 3-3 downstairs and upstairs, operator stays behind cause that buff spawns downstairs. Downstairs clear absolutely everything, upstairs leaves 1 servitor alive and looks for the scanner vandal to acquire that augment. Upstairs kills their last servitor when operator is upstairs and everyone is ready. The scanner looks for the glowing yellow copy, everybody damages it till it dies, someone picks up the debuff, scanner puts augment in the terminal. Upstairs, downstairs, upstairs, downstairs does this process, then it resets. Operator upstairs will take care of people with debuff, so downstairs players will need to take the elevator."

4. **In Detail:** Initially only 2 players head upstairs straight away, the operator stays downstairs and helps with add clear since the operator vandal will spawn downstairs. Once picked up, they'll head upstairs and help out there. Downstairs clears all their adds, and then groups up by the back middle terminal. Upstairs clears everything bar 1 servitor, finds the scanner vandal and picks up the augment, and once the operator arrives the final servitor can be killed. This starts the damage phase beginning upstairs, it is split into 4 bursts alternating between upstairs and downstairs. "Extinction Protocol activated.." appears in the text chat, and all the copies of the boss will raise their arms so the scanner will have to look for the one with a glowing yellow aura. All players on that floor head over, damage it together (>5s!!), then when the copy dies one person picks up the replication debuff, and the scanner puts their augment in the nearest terminal. It is crucial that the scanner augment is deposited into a terminal as soon as possible after damaging a copy of the boss. At this point, the team on the other floor will have a short damage window, where they repeat the same steps. It then goes back upstairs, then downstairs one last time before the damage phase concludes. The downstairs players that pick up the replication debuffs will have to head upstairs so the operator can deal with them, the upstairs players can simply stay where they are, following the operator's orders. After 4 bursts of damage, the encounter begins anew with add-clear. The only difference with final stand is that everything takes place upstairs, and that there will be twice as many copies of the boss than usual, which means more work for the scanner, the mechanics and timings remain the same. To make things easier, it helps to dedicate a scanner for downstairs, and one for upstairs, and decide beforehand who scans during final stand. for the operator, they can refresh players' replication debuff timers by shooting it off the players' head, allowing it to be refreshed. They can shoot the datapads next to the airlocks to open them, and then shoot the debuffs off the players to dispose of them. They can also send elevators up or down by shooting the datapads next to them.

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** Shooting the wrong copy of the boss during the damage phase. Having the timer on the replication debuff expire. Slow transfers of the scanner augment. Not listening to operator callouts. 

6. **Combat:** Quite low add density, but the orangebar tracer shanks are very deadly, these should be cleared asap. Other than that you're only dealing with wretches stabbing you, and the boss' copies shooting at you. The Sentinel servitors are unchanged from the previous encounter, as are the augmented vandals. no champions.

### 3. Rapture/Descent:

_Summary:_ "We need to dunk 6 pairs of 2 nuclear cores each, while identifying the correct baskets, preventing a 3rd core from spawning, and stunning the boss."

1. **Objective:** Dunk 6 pair of 2 nuclear cores each.

2. **Sightseeing:** Show the 3 areas, each with their own terminal, own suppression node, and the 2 core spawns on left and right respectively. Explain positioning of baskets (spawn, window, left, right).

3. **Quick Rundown:** Each wave is heralded by an audio cue and text message. The scanner will call out the 2 glowing baskets, the operator will shoot a glowing red datapad to stop a 3rd core from spawning, and the suppressor will begin the stunning process, going from node to node. Two players will head to where the 2 cores spawn, pick them up and run to the baskets, where they'll be able to dunk once the suppressor has shot Taniks once from under each node. One augment will be deactivated after stunning, simply deposit in the terminal and let somebody else do the job. Repeat this 5 more times."

4. **In Detail:** Each wave begins with a beeping audio cue and the message "Several nuclear cores begin charging...", at which point all 3 augment players should begin with their tasks. The scanner will identify and call out the two glowing baskets. The operator will have to seek out and shoot one red glowing datapad to prevent a 3rd core from spawning. The suppressor will have to shoot Taniks once under each node in order to stun him, which unlocks the baskets for dunking. 2 players will have to head over to where the 2 cores are spawning and will have to pick these up within 10s and take them to the baskets that were called out. Once picked up, players can only walk and single-jump, and will slowly gain stacks of "Radiation" which kills them at x10. These stacks slowly go away when a player is not carrying a core. Once the message "Taniks is stunned. An augment has been deactivated." appears, the baskets can be dunked into, and one augment will be deactivated. The player will have an audio cue, and their buff display will read "Deactivated Augment", which they will have to deposit into a terminal for another player to pick up and do their task for the next round. After 6 rounds in total, the grey area in the middle will open up and players will have to drop down and run forwards, where they will then be taken to the next encounter.

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** Very high add-density could cause issues. Letting a core expire either in its spawner or on the ground will cause a wipe. Dunking in the wrong basket will kill a player. 10 stacks of radiation will kill a player. Scanner needs to call out the correct baskets, operator needs to shoot a datapad (although 3-core is salvageable), and suppressor needs to be quick with shooting Taniks under each node. 

6. **Combat:** Short to medium length engagements with a very high amount of adds. Mainly redbars like shanks and marauders, but once per phase void-shielded yellowbar captains and one overload captain will spawn. Neither of them bear any mechanical significance.

### 4. Restricted/Shaniks/Taniks 2, Electric Boogaloo: 

_Summary:_ "We need to add-clear the 3 areas in the encounter, destroy Tanik's rocket boosters to obtain and dunk 4 (2) nuclear cores, after which we will damage Taniks."

1. **Objective:** Defeat Taniks, the Abonimation.

2. **Sightseeing:** Show spawn, blue and orange; that each side has its own 3 suppression nodes, its own 2 baskets and its own terminal. Try to show the rings of debris around Taniks in the centre along with where to wait for damage phase.

3. **Quick Rundown:** Split up 2 players per side, kill all the adds and pick up your respective augment. Taniks will head to one of the 3 sides after a short while, his rocket boosters on all 4 corners will open up and need to be shot till each one has dropped a nuclear core. Players collect these and run to the baskets to dunk. In the meantime, the suppressor shoots Taniks from under each node to unlock the baskets, and the operator frees any players caught in a purple bubble. Once all cores are dunked, gather for DPS, which is done in the goldilocks zone between the debris rings.

4. **In Detail:** Each side will have 2 players, where one player is the main augment user, and the second one is the backup, in case of a 2-phase and a deactivated augment. Spawn will always have the operator vandal spawn there, Blue will have the scanner, and Orange will have the Suppressor. The vandal spawns after killing the void-shielded yellowbar captain. Timing-wise, Taniks usually makes his way over to one side around the time or shortly after the augments from the vandals have been picked up. Once there, he will expose the 4 rocket boosters on the corners of his shank chassis, which need to be shot quickly to drop 4 cores from them in total. Taniks will release vertical torrents of void light will his boosters are being shot which will kill a player of they stay in them for too long. The cores should be picked up only once all 4 have been dropped, they still have the same 10s timer from last encounter. At this point, the 4 players carrying cores will split up and head to the two sides where Tanik is NOT at. The operator will free players detained by Tanik's purple bubble by shooting the pink dots on it. The suppressor will shoot Taniks from under the nodes in the area he went to, but only the first two. They will wait to shoot him under the 3rd node until the operator has shot the the 2nd void bubble and called it out. While there is no message saying so, the message "Taniks is stunned. An augment has been deactivated." from the last encounter still applies. Once Taniks has been shot from under the 3rd node, the baskets will be unlocked for dunking, and one of the 3 augments will be deactivated. The affected player should deposit their augment in the nearest terminal before gathering for DPS. Players will jump into the goldilocks zone between the outer ring of debris floating around Taniks and the inner shock field just below him. After around 12-15s, Taniks will stomp, throwing players out of the ring, so they will have to jump back in in order to continue damaging Taniks. Once he reaches final stand, he will teleport from area to area, releasing the void torrents once more, and players will simply have to track him and finish him off.

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** Being too slow with add clear, delaying augment vandal spawns. Not dropping cores quickly enough. Picking up a core before all 4 are dropped. Getting killed by the void torrents. Dying to stacks of radiation. Operator not being quick enough. Suppressor finishing the stun too early, possibly deactivating the operator. Suppressor finishing too late, killing players due to stacks of radiation. Cores being on the ground for more than 10s. Dunking in the wrong baskets, although this only applies for the 2-core strat. Getting hit by the debris or shock field when damaging Taniks.

6. **Combat:** Mainly close to medium range engagements, mainly dealing with dregs and the occasional void-shielded yellowbar captain. Same augmented vandals as the rest of the raid. No champions.
