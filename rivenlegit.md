# Riven Legit strat

(muggs' slightly less scuffed quick guide because he rewrote it)

### Part 1

**Room A** - Riven first, Captain second:  
Stun riven by either baiting her tentacle and shooting it or by shooting her glowing red mouth between the fire attacks. once she has been stunned, she'll open her flaps and reveal her 10 eyes, 2 of which will be glowing. write this down.

**Room B** - capt first, riven second:  
clear out all the ads, but wait to kill the captain until you have the eyes callout. riven will appear shortly, so prepare to DPS her mouth until it closes, which is when you shoot the 2 eyes that were called out. 

### Part 2

**Room A** - riven first, capt second:  
now that riven has retreated, clear all your ads, kill the captain and pick up the essence. said "cleanser" will look towards the glass where they'll see and call out their symbol, another player behind the glass will guide them to where this symbol is located. once there, the cleanser will press grenade to cleanse, which will activate the lift to get to the 2nd floor.

**Room B** - capt first, riven second:  
now that riven is gone, pick up the essence you got from killing the captain, and complete the cleansing mechanic to activate your lift

### Part 3 and 4

After this, each side will arrive on the 2nd floor on their side, where they will repeat the exact same steps, but with roles reversed. So if Room A had riven first capt second, they'll have capt first riven second, and Room B will have riven first capt second. Once all the mechanics have been completed, the lifts will take both teams to the top floor where they'll join forces again 

### Part 5

Work together to clear ads and stun riven 3 times (tentacle/fire) in order to get 3 sets of 2 eyes each. the 4th time riven appears, theres a small DPS window, so shoot her mouth till it closes (5s!!), then shoot the 6 eyes (at the same time ideally) that were called out. doing so resets the encounter, meaning it is time to get back on the plates. once you start dropping down, shoot rivens pimples for loads of extra damage, and avoid the axion darts 

### Part 6

Taken jumping puzzle. literally the same as always

### Part 7

final stand, also the same as always
