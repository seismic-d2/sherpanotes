Objective/Summary -> Sightseeing -> Quick Rundown -> In Detail -> Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics -> Combat -> Loadouts

### 0. Looking Glass (Entrance) and Divinity Puzzle Activation:

- Clear all the adds until the large portal activates, then head inside to get teleported into the ac
- Activate the Divinity puzzles by having anyone with the quest drop down into the room below where you get teleported to after stepping through the portal.
- Complete the first puzzle, before the first encounter.

### 1. Embrace (Consecrated Mind chase):

1. **Objective/Summary:** "We need to follow the boss, picking up the vex cubes he drops, while unlocking rooms using the tether mechanic so that we can progress further.

2. **Sightseeing:** Show the players the tether box (start point) and the tether cross (end), you can also peek through the vex door to see the next room and the next door.

3. **Quick Rundown:** Split into 3 teams of 2, one for each room. Team 1 stays in the first room and picks up the two vex cubes the boss drops, the other 4 players unlock the second room, clears out all the adds and the Angelic and opens the door to the third room. Team 2 stays in the second room, waiting for the boss to appear there, with Team 1 "leapfrogging" Team 2 and joining up with Team 3 in the third room to clear adds and tether to open the next door. Team 2 will pick up their cubes in the second room, and Team 3 will pick up theirs in the third room. In the fourth room, the boss doesn't appear, all players just clear the adds and complete the 3 tethers. In the final "room", the boss drops 3 cubes, so players will have to coordinate who picks them up.

4. **In Detail:** Part 3 already explains how things go down. The main difficulty in this encounter comes from having to be quick and keeping an eye on the boss at all times. The tether will go turn orange when it is close to breaking, and remain white when not under tension. The spawn locations of the tether boxes are randomized between 2-3 possible locations in each room, but the tether cross is always in the same place. The tether box only unlocks and lets you tether once you have killed the Angelic, which is a yellowbar Hydra. The Angelic only spawns once you have killed all/enough adds. The boss will only teleport to each different room once the next door has been opened, so f.ex he will only teleport to the second room once the door to the third room has been unlocked. The cube that the boss drops can remain on the ground for about 5s before expiring. The debuff for picking up the cube is called "Voltaic Overflow" and lasts 2min30s, if a player picks up another cube in that time, it will count, but the player will die. In the fourth room, there are 3 tethers, that are always performed in the same order, and their tether boxes are always in the same spot. In the final "room" the boss will teleport and drop 3 cubes, usually the 2 players from Team 1 and the player that picked up first from Team 2 will be able to pick up these cubes, but in practicality anyone that doesn't have the debuff can just pick them up.

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** Failing to pick up a vex cube. Most often this happens in the first room if the 4 players heading to the second room are too slow with unlocking the door, causing the boss to drop a third cube in the first room, which Team 1 often vacates as soon as they've picked up their two cubes, so pay particular attention to that. Other than that, there is no wipe mechanic, as long as all cubes are picked up in some way, the encounter can be completed.

6. **Combat:** mainly medium range, consisting of all types of vex, goblins, hobgoblins, fanatics, orangebar minotaurs (void shields), cyclopses, the yellowbar Angelic hydras, and overload minotaurs.

### 1.1. Undergrowth (Interlude between 1st & 2nd encounters) Divinity puzzles:

- After completing the first encounter, head back on the left side of the field and drop down to complete the second divinity puzzle.
- Head back up to the field and proceed further, dropping down into the Undergrowth load zone, where the third divinity puzzle is to the right side.

### 2. Undergrowth (defend the Confluxes):

1. **Objective/Summary:** "We need to defend 4 confluxes, keeping adds from sacrificing themselves, refreshing our own buffs, until eventually the middle area opens and we defend a 5th conflux together."

2. **Sightseeing:** Point out the conflux, the tether cross on top of it, the tether box in each lane, and use images to illustrate the diamond shape of the encounter. 

3. **Quick Rundown:** Set up one defender for each of the four confluxes, and two runners for confluxes 1-2 and 3-4 respectively. Defender 1 stays at the first conflux, tethers with their runner to get the Enlightened buff (45s), the rest of the team heads to conflux 2 (left lane, clockwise counting), clears it out, and defender 2 and the other runner tether to acquire the buff while defenders 3 and 4 continue to conflux 3. They clear it out, tether to receive the buff (with or without the runner), and leave defender 3 there. By this point, the 3-4 runner should have caught up with defender 4 as they head to conflux 4, clear out the ads and tether to buff themselves. At this point, every conflux is manned, and all portals are active. Now the runners just have to buff their 2 defenders each when necessary and help them kill Angelics when they appear. When each conflux has killed their Angelics, the middle opens up, and players work together to tether and defend conflux 5.

4. **In Detail:** Once again, describing how things go down already covers most things. The adds at the rally flag are very jumpy, so even just walking too close or shooting anywhere at all might trigger the encounter. Just like last encounter, the tether box for each conflux can only be used if no Angelics there are alive. Each conflux will always get 3 angelics. Spawns of adds always come in waves; "Undergrowth defenses deployed" signals that adds have spawned and lasts 30s, after which "Undergrowth defenses subsided" appears, which gives 15s of downtime with no add spawns. Ideally, tethering should be done in those 15s, but it is not mechanically necessary. Once a conflux has been tethered to once, that enables shielded adds to spawn, their shields can only be destroyed by players that have the "Enlightened" buff (one bullet suffices) which last for 45s and is acquired by any player that took part in a tether at any of the confluxes. The portals between confluxes only activate once the confluxes on either side have been tethered to (activated) and stay active indefinitely, even during the next encounter. The order in which angelics spawn is random, it might be 2-4-3-1 one time and 1-2-3-4 the next, there is no telling and players will simply have to communicate. Ideally the runner for an affected conflux should head over there using the portals to help their defender. Once the last angelic of the 4th wave has been killed, the doors to the middle open, and all players should head there, ideally you retether just before this happens. In the middle, you'll get 2 waves of 3 angelics which spawn in random locations, and plenty of shielded adds, on the same 30s/15s rotation as before. Additionally, Supplicants also spawn during this time.

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** Letting too many adds (~ 3 goblins or 1 minotaur + 1 goblin) sacrifice themselves at any conflux will wipe the entire time. Other than that, there are no wipe conditions. The main difficulty comes from keeping as many people buffed as possible so that shielded adds can be dealt with. Clearing out the confluxes initially can be a bit challenging.

6. **Combat:** Mainly close and medium range, mainly dealing with goblins, fanatics and regular minotaurs. Angelics are once again yellowbar, and confluxes 2,3,4 will have two barrier hobgoblin champions to deal with when initially clearing out the conflux.

### 3. Consecrated Mind, Sol Inherent (Harpy Bossfight):

1. **Objective/Summary:** "We need to collect and bank 30 motes at the active conflux, while collecting vex cubes again and performing a stun mechanic until all the motes are banked, after which we have our DPS phase."

2. **Sightseeing:** It is possible to roam the map freely and visit each conflux, along with the spots where the boss will go to drop his cubes, but this isn't strictly necessary.

3. **Quick Rundown:** Split 3 players into the gambit team, picking up 5 (player 1), 10 (player 2), 10 (player 3), 5 (player 1) motes each. The eyes team has each played pick up the vex cube once. Gambit players simply need to find minotaurs, kill them, pick up the 5 motes each that they drop and run to the active conflux once they have enough motes, then deposit there to obtain the Enlightened buff (45s) to defend the conflux from shielded adds. Eyes players need to pick up the vex cube in the same way they did in the first encounter, but the player that picks it up needs to look at the boss and call out if the inner or outer eyes on it are glowing, and the eyes team then needs to quickly shoot those to complete the stun mechanic. Once 30 motes are banked, the boss goes to the active conflux, spread his wings, players need to shoot all the eyes, then DPS begins and players need to move forwards as the boss moves backwards.

4. **In Detail:** The rundown covers most of it. The active conflux shines a massive beam of light into the sky, literally like a beacon in Minecraft. Theoretically you could do 10-10-10 for dunking motes, but 5-10-10-5 is a sure-fire to always have somebody with a buff at the active conflux, since shielded adds will start going there basically as soon the encounter starts. Each minotaurs drops 5 motes, and they only spawn in the 4 lanes. The boss only ever goes into the "short lanes" to drop his cubes. Players should keep some distance between where the boss drops his cube and themselves, since sometimes having the cube dropped on top of you will just kill the player. Only the player that has picked up the cube can see which eyes are glowing on the boss, ideally they should only look at and shoot the middle one, since all 3 eyes will either be inner or outer, their teammates can shoot the left and right eyes respectively, and it is also possible to solo the mechanic. The debuff from picking up the cube last the same 2m30s as in the first encounter, picking up another within that timeframe will kill the player, and won't allow for the stun to be completed. The boss will head to the charged conflux as soon as 30 motes are dunked, even if he is on his way to drop a vex cube, he'll just change his mind and head to the conflux instead. Before DPS, all the eyes need to be shot, just like in Spire of the Watcher. During DPS, the boss will move backwards, and all players should run and gun, since a wall will spawn that locks players out from doing DPS if they just stay at the conflux. 

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** Once again, having too many adds sacrifice will wipe the team. Failing to pick up a vex cube will wipe the team. Shooting the wrong eyes or not shooting the eyes (quickly enough) will kill the player that picked up the cube. Each vex sacrificed at the conflux counts for -5 motes, so it is theoretically possible to recover. In recent times, adds spawn and sacrifice themselves at the next conflux just as the damage phase, before players can even see which one it is, this is a bug and not intended, but it is annoying and could cause players to have to dunk more than 30 motes total in case of a second phase being necessary.

6. **Combat:** almost exclusively close range. regular goblins, supplicants and yellowbar void-shielded minotaurs.

### 3.1. Divinity puzzles after the third encounter

- Puzzle 4 and Puzzle 5 are in the same area in the middle
- Puzzle 6 and Puzzle 7 are behind a waterfall

### 4. Sanctified Mind:

1. **Objective/Summary:** "We need to collect 30 motes of 2 different types and bank them, while rebuilding platforms until we can tether the boss and damage him."

2. **Sightseeing:** It is possible to show where the blue and orange islands are, where the confluxes can spawn, where the tether crosses are, and where the cyclopses spawn.

3. **Quick Rundown:** Split into 3 teams of 2; Gambit 1, Gambit 2 and Builders. The 2 gambit teams will go on through the blue portal first and collect 30 motes total (15x2) and bank them at the blue conflux in order to lock it against vex sacrifices. After that, they will do the same with the orange portal and bank them at the orange conflux to lock that and proceed to DPS. The blue portal is opened by shooting the boss' leg crit, and the orange one by shooting his shoulder crit, and if players are already on an island, it will teleport them back to the rally flag. Every time a crit is shot, he destroys one platform, and the builders can tether from a conflux to a tether cross to rebuild it. When players bank motes, they get the Enlightened buff (45s) which lets them destroy the white shields on adds. Once both confluxes are locked, the boss chooses one conflux at random, which players then tether from to the boss to essentially stun him to then do DPS.

4. **In Detail:** This is one of many possible strategies, but it allows an element of safety due to being able to lock one conflux, which prevents vex from being able to sacrifice there. With the beginning of every phase and just before players tether for boss DPS, an angelic spawns which disables the tether box on all confluxes. With every crit spot shot, the boss destroys one platform, but also spawns 1 cyclops on the respective side he was shot on. The shields can once again be broken with 1 shot. Players are only able to carry max 10 motes, and cannot mix different types of motes. If goblins spawn on an island, there will 15 motes available, if harpies spawn, there will be 18 available. If 3 phases have been completed the boss also begins to spawn an overload minotaur on each island. Builders should very clearly call out when they are building, focus mainly on platforms that only require a 2-person tether to restore, and try to only build when there are no adds. Ideally all players should build platforms in the brief downtime after DPS ends and before the next angelic spawns.

5. **Difficulties/Wipe Mechanics:** Players missing their turn to jump into a portal messes up the rotation a lot. Motes dropping off the map requiring a 3rd entry on each side. Players dying with motes on them before banking. Players taking too long to clear out their island causing the enlightened buff for the home players to expire. When platforms disappear or are rebuilt, players should stay clear. Failing to tether to the boss in time before DPS causes a wipe, or failing to fill the conflux does the same. Pulling players back too early also messes up rotations.

6. **Combat:** all ranges, with almost exclusively redbars, apart from the yellowbar angelic. Stasis Turrets and Arc Souls can cause the boss to glitch out, do not use them.
