### 0. Orbs

The objective of this encounter is to dunk 6 pairs of orbs together with your teammate. These need to be dunked within ~5 seconds of each other, and there will be a timer while carrying orbs so you will have to move quickly. The first set of orbs will be in the main room, and from that point onwards there'll be 1 orb per side, moving further and further away from the middle with each set. Dunking takes place on the statue which is lit up and is holding a dark orb.

Split up into 3 teams of 2, with 1 runner for left and 1 runner for right, and 1 ad clearer for each side. The remaining two players stay in middle to clear ads and more importantly, open the main and side doors. The ad clearers on each side will also have to open 1 door. In terms of strategy, the two dunkers get to their orbs, and coordinate their pickup so that it is nearly simultaneous. The ad clearers will then essentially clear a path and open the doors so that the runners can just run straight to middle with no delays in order to dunk.

Some things to remember:
- The timer starts when you dunk/fail to dunk orbs, not when you pick them up. That is why you should also run quickly to the orbs using platforms instead of going through the spawn room. If you know you can't make it in time, return to the orb spawn points to grab them as soon as they spawn, which will give you max time to dunk them.
- While carrying an orb, use jump-light attack to move much faster. This is the same technique as with most orb relics in the game.

### 1. Totems

The objective for this encounter is to deposit enough stacks of **Deathsinger's Power** in order to fill up a meter which will unlock the door to progress forwards. We'll split into 2 teams of 3, with the left and right side trios doing their rotation entirely independently from one another. There will occasionally be an unstoppable ogre in the middle room.

There are 3 "stations" which each player will have to go through, always in the same order:
- Station 1 is on the balcony, killing the wizard and then the taken knight in order to obtain the **Brand Stealer** buff, with which they will go into their respective room. They'll run to the plate and steal the brand from their teammate who is standing on the plate underneath the totem once they count down. 
- Station 2 is standing on the plate underneath the totem while having the the Brand buff, killing ads in order to gain stacks of **Deathsinger's Power**, wherein redbars count for 1 stack and orangebars for 3. 
- Station 3 is having the brand stolen from you, meaning you need to run back to the main room and stand on the plate in order to deposit your stacks of **Deathsinger's Power**. Once your stacks have been drained from you (this process is automatic), you return to station 1 and the cycle repeats itself.

Both sides do exactly this rotation, but independently from each other on the left and right sides. Each player also starts at a different station. In order to begin, the brands are already on the floor in the entryway to the rooms, so 1 player on each side will pick it up, run in and do station 2 (stand on plate and kill ads). Another player will be on the balcony working to obtain the **Brand Stealer** buff, which corresponds to Station 1. The third player is technically at Station 3, but since they won't have any stacks at the start, they'll just help the player at Station 2 kill their wizard and knight. The wizard itself only spawns after the brand has been swapped/stolen, with the knight spawning after the wizard has been killed, and the **Brand Stealer** buff will always spawn in the same spot regardless of where the knight dies.

Some things to remember:
- When depositing stacks on the middle platform, don't kill any small adds, but instead you can damage the knights as long as you don't kill them, which will help totem defenders a lot.
- Totem can stay unattended for a few seconds without wiping the team, use it to stay alive or meet your brand stealer half way if the timers are low.
- Players that have completed Station 1 and are running into the room with the **Brand Stealer** buff should call out and asks their teammate at the totem for the timer. The player with the timer must communicate when to steal the buff in order to maximize time, and if the timer is low, the two players may have to meet halfway and steal buff off the plate.

### 2. Warpriest

The objective of this encounter is to defeat the Warpriest. The encounter is divided into an add-clearing phase, a reading phase, the damage phase, and the wipe mechanic. We'll split into 3 teams of 2 for left, middle and right respectively, with each side having 1 reader and left and right having 1 knight killer each, leaving 1 roamer.

The add clearing phase is straight forward, simply kill all the ads that spawn, including 2 yellowbars per side. At the end of the phase, 1 orangebar knight will spawn on each side, once all 3 are killed, the add clearing phase ends. Once the Warpriest is below 50% health, the enemy type will change from Hive to Taken, but everything else remains the same.

The reading phase is heralded by messages in the action chat. *"Glyph reading sequence started"* lets everyone know that reading has to take place. The middle reader will step on their plate and look for which pillar is glowing, and they will call that out. Regardless of which pillar is glowing, they will step off the plate after their first callout, and the game will say *"Glyph sequence started"*. At that point, the side which was called out (f.ex left side) will step on their plate, and look for the next glowing pillar (f.ex middle) and call it out. Left reader stays on their plate as the next person gets on their plate, at which point only one pillar remains, who'll get on last, giving them the **Brand of the Initiate** buff which starts with a 20s timer. If any player gets on in the wrong order, or gets off too early during the glyph sequence, the game will say *"Glyph sequence broken"*, the plates will set on fire and it'll most likely wipe you. 

The damage phase will begin practically as soon as the last reader steps on their plate and receives the **Brand of the Initiate** buff. The 3 readers and the roamer will gather together and begin shooting the boss, with the buff carrier counting down their timer. At this point, the two knight killers will look for and coordinate who kills which taken knight. These knights have set spawn points and orders, they will *never* spawn on the side that had the last plate. 1 player will kill the first knight, grab the **Brand Claimer** buff and head to the DPS spot, joining in for damage on the boss, and stealing the **Brand of the Initiate** once the player countdown gets to around 3s. The second knight killer will also kill theirs, pick up the buff, join the team for DPS, and steal when the timer gets low. The first knight spawns immediately after reading concludes, and the 2nd knight spawns immediately after the first one has been killed. Once these two refreshes have taken place, the team has to listen closely to the countdown, as once this hits zero, the buff expires and damage ends.

Once damage ends, the team will have to move together and hide behind one of the 3 pillars together. These cast a shadow which protects players from the wipe mechanic **Searing Oculus**. Each pillar can only be used as a hiding spot once, since it is destroyed if the players hide behind it. Once the blinding light recedes, the encounter starts from the top again with the add clearing phase. When a pillar is destroyed, the reading is actually facilitated even further, since visibility is improved. 

### 3. Golgoroth

The objective of this encounter is to defeat Golgoroth. The encounter is divided into an add-clearing phase and a damage phase, which itself is subdivided into 6 stations. The team will split in two, with 4 people dedicated entirely for boss-damage, and 2 players as boss baiters.

The add-clearing is very straightforward, all the adds spawn in the back half of the room. These simply need to be killed until two redbar Knights spawn on the sides. Once these are killed, the add-clearing phase concludes.

For the damage phase, players will have to make sure that a boss baiter can see Golgoroth's back in order to shoot it. The 4 boss damage players will then shoot the orb hanging from the ceiling, which drops and splatters into a pool of **Reclaimed Light**, from which the players must do damage. The boss baiter who was able to see Golgoroth's back will make sure to shoot his back before the other players drop the orb. Doing so will have the message *Golgoroth shifts his Gaze to [Player]" pop up in the action chat, with the player getting the buff **Golgoroth's Gaze** on the side of their screen with a 20s timer. This player will have to make sure to rotate the boss in such a way so that their teammates stood in the pit can see Golgoroth's crit spot on his belly, this is easiest achieved by simply standing in line behind their teammates. Golgoroth will shoot a lot of aggressive Axion Darts at the player with **Golgoroth's Gaze**, so they will have to make sure to shoot these, since they don't just damage them, but briefly poison the player with **Ogre's Venom**. In the damage team, one player will randomly get the **Unstable Light** timer, which essentially turns them into a cursed thrall. They should run up to the boss, and once their timer reaches 0, they will detonate a large explosion which does a lot of damage. If they fail to move from where their teammates are, they will kill them. This constitutes 1 station of the damage phase. As the Gaze holder's timer runs low, their boss baiting teammate, who should be stood exactly opposite from the Gaze holder, will shoot Golgoroth's back, transferring **Golgoroth's Gaze** to themselves. The players in the pit will have to shoot and drop the next orb in order to do damage. The rest is the same as before, and all these processes and mechanics are repeated for a total of 6 stations. Adds will periodically spawn in the pit during the damage phase, mainly taken thrall and a few taken phalanxes.

Once all 6 stations have been used, the action chat will read *Golgoroth grows tired*, which heralds the add-clearing phase beginning again. Should the team fail to transfer the Gaze, or should the Gaze holder die, the damage phase will instantly end, and the add-clearing phase will begin again. The amount of missed stations/orbs will be displayed on the central pillar in the room, and once all 6 symbols on the pillar are lit up due to having missed orbs/stations, the team will wipe.

### 4. Daughters

The objective of this encounter is to kill the Deathsinger bosses, Ir Halak and Ir Anuk. The encounter is split into the orb collecting phase and the damage phase. The team will be split into 4 plate people, each person having a dedicated plate, L1, R1, L2, R2, and 2 rotators that will fill in as needed. The plate players will go to their designated plates and the rotators will stay in middle to begin with. 

In order to unlock damage, 3 pieces of the **Blightguard** need to be found, i.e. 3 orbs need to be picked up. These orbs float high in the sky above a plate, and players must build a stairway in order to reach it. The starting plate for the stairway is clearly marked, since it will be glowing green and have an orangebar knight on it, who needs to be killed. The location of the orb, and thus the end plate, can only be seen by players stood on the starting plate. The players will call the end plate out, and another player will step on it, and then after around 3-4s, a few platforms will materialize. The player that has to scale these platforms and pick up the orb is the "torn" player, they will have the **Torn Between Dimensions** debuff, which turns their screen monochromatic, disables abilities and weapons, and only allows them to use their movement (no icarus, shatterdive or trapper's ambush though). They will jump from platform to platform, finally jumping through the orb, after which the game will say *A piece of the Blightguard is found* in the action chat and the player will be relieved of their **Torn Between Dimensions** debuff. This process of killing the knight on the start plate, finding the orb and calling out the end plate, building the bridge and having the torn player collect the orb repeats for a total of 3 times. On the third time, the player will have to interact with the orb.

For the damage phase itself, the final torn player who interacted with the orb will drop down to one of the wizards, specifically the one that has been shooting arc bolts the entire time thus far. They'll drop down to the pillar, press a quick interact prompt, which will drop the boss' shield, and actually transfer either the **Aura of Weaving** or **Aura of Unraveling** buff to that player, which allows anyone standing within their proximity to both damage the boss and survive the wipe mechanic that occurs when the overarching timer **Hymn of Weaving** expires. This wipe mechanic consists of a blinding light, during which players must stick together and wait it out till the **Hymn of Weaving** timer reappears again. It is generally recommended to stand on the little step platform on the opposite pillar of the boss you are damaging, since plenty of adds spawn during the damage phase.

After the wipe mechanic, players will begin anew with collecting pieces of the Blightguard the same way they did before, and will do damage as before, this time stealing the brand from the other wizard however. This will continue till both bosses are dead. Failing to steal the brand in time from the wizard will cause a wipe. If a player steals from the "wrong" wizard, the fireteam must kill that boss in one cycle, otherwise they will wipe.

### 5. Oryx

The objective of this encounter is to defeat Oryx, the Taken King. This encounter builds entirely on the mechanics of the previous Daughters of Oryx encounter, but expands upon them. Team structure will remain the same, 4 plate people and 2 rotators. The general idea of collecting 3 pieces of the Blightguard and building the platforms to do so remains the same. This encounter is split into an intro phase, an expanded orb collecting phase, a stun and damage phase, and then an interlude phase before looping back to the beginning.

The intro phase begins by approaching Toland at the far end of the room, which will start the encounter, causing adds to spawn and Oryx to appear. Simply clear the adds (mainly thrall) and kill the orangebar knight that appears on each plate. Once these have been killed, Oryx will randomly decide to go either to the left or right, and on that side will choose a particular plate to slam his fist down on to. This signifies the end of the intro phase, the begin of the orb phase and also informs players which plate is the starting plate for the first set. 

From here, the mechanics of the orb collecting are the exact same as in Daughters, except that there will be no knight indicating where the start plate is, instead the plate will just glow green. An additional mechanic is introduced wherein **Lighteater Ogres** will spawn in a counterclockwise fashion from the "slammed plate" in a staggered fashion a few seconds apart; these ogres always spawn in the same puddle in the corner and must be killed as soon as possible. Doing so will drop a **Corrupted Light**, more commonly referred to as a Taken bomb, it looks a bit like a minituare Taken Blight. Once an ogre is killed, a Lighteater Knight will spawn diagonally across from where this Ogre was killed. This Knight will ignore players and simply run towards the "bomb" to try and detonate it, thus they must also be killed asap. These additional mechanics will take place while players are building platforms and collecting orbs, in total 4 ogres and 4 knights need to be killed. For the final orb, the "torn" player must once again interact with it, this time dropping down into the middle where a **Vessel of Oryx** knight will be roaming around, from which they must steal the brand, granting them the **Aura of Immortality**. This concludes the orb collecting phase.

At this point, Oryx will once again slam his fist on to the same plate as before, after which *Oryx calls upon the Darkness* will appear in the action chat. Players should already be within proximity of their "bomb", ready to step inside. A quick countdown, then 1 player will step into each bomb at the same time, waiting inside until *[Player] has detonated a Corrupted Light* appears in the action chat. As soon as that appears for the respective player, they will sprint back to middle and get inside the **Aura of Immortality** to survive a bright flash of light (which acts as a wipe mechanic). As long as at least 1 bomb is detonated, Oryx will be stunned, allowing players to damage to his chest. The more bombs are detonated, the longer the damage phase lasts.

Once Oryx's chest closes, damage concludes, and he moves to the far end of the room again. At this point, there are two possibilites: he may either instantly spawn an orangebar Taken Knight on each plate, along with bombs that track players and detonate when near other players. The Knights must be killed asap in order to beat this "minigame". The other option is that he spawns a large taken orb in the front of the room, into which one player after another will be randomly teleported. Inside of the orb, they must kill the **Shade of Oryx**, which is essentially a mini-boss that teleports around a lot. Once whichever minigame has been successfully completed, the encounter starts from the top again with the intro phase.

Oryx's health bar includes a final stand portion. For that part, Oryx will move to the far end of the room again, and two ogres will spawn, first at R2 and then at L2, slightly staggered. These must be killed, since Oryx will once again *call upon the Darkness*, so one player will have to go and detonate at the very least the bomb at R2. The rest of the player can remain in the middle and already beging damaging. If needed, the second bomb at L2 can also be detonated to extend the damage phase a bit further. Like with all final stands, this is do or die.
